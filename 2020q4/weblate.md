In search of new contributors an article was published in the
September/October 2020 issue of the FreeBSD Journal about How to Become a
FreeBSD Translator.

During the whole year we received new contributors to the effort; numbers are
still growing and we are receiving translations almost daily on our Weblate
platform.
