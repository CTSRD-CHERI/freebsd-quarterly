NetApp has started an effort to upstream fixes from the ONTAP code line
that benefit the FreeBSD community. These changes benefit the FreeBSD
community by providing fixes that NetApp has made, while allowing NetApp
to reduce the customizations needed when bringing the latest FreeBSD
changes into the ONTAP code line.

During the fourth quarter, Klara has made 40 upstream fixes in the kernel in geom, dev, amd64, net, kern, netinet, and several other areas on behalf of NetApp.

NetApp intends to continue to sponsor this effort throughout 2021.
