The FreeBSD Office team works on a number of office-related software suites 
and tools such as OpenOffice and LibreOffice.  

Work during this quarter focused on providing the latest stable release of 
LibreOffice suite and companion apps to all FreeBSD users.

Latest and quarterly ports branches got a series of updates of the LibreOffice suite 
from 7.0.1 thru 7.0.4 releases, compilation patches for all Tier 1 architectures,
and updates of all companion libraries. Some of our local and critical to build patches 
were sent to and accepted by upstream.

Meanwhile, our WIP repository was moved to new home under official github.org/freebsd resources.

The WIP repository also has a major update with development versions of the LibreOffice suite,
version 7.1.0.0.beta1 for now. Release will be planned in March, 2021.

We are looking for people to help the project.
All unstable work with LibreOffice snapshots is staged in our [WIP repository](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports-libreoffice).
