Paragraphs are separated with an empty line.  Use Markdown
syntax, the same as you use on GitHub.  If you don't know
Markdown, just write it as if it was plain text.

Show the importance of your work.  Status reports are not
just about telling everyone that things were done, they also
need to explain why they were done.

The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the
overall direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and
personnel matters.  Below is what happened in the last quarter.

  * #ports #PR #PRunassigned #commits #committers conclusion
  * commit bits granted/safekept (who/why)
  * portmgr news/members
  * infra: USES, default-versions, big changes
  * major port updates (pkg), Firefox, Chromium
  * exp-runs, pkg-builders, other infra

If help is needed, make this explicit.  List tasks, with enough
detail that people know if they are likely to be able to do them,
and invite people to get in contact:

  * Help for PRs?
  * Help for testing?
  * Help for documentation?
